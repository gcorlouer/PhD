## GC planification
* Goal: compare Granger causality in visual electrodes in various conditions stimuli vs rest data
* Compare GC place vs face electrodes
* Do this on raw signal and bipolar montage
* Spectral and temporal GC
* Compare amplitude

06/07/2020:
* Run GC on stimulus vs rest data on high frequency band 
* Sliding window analysis
* Compare what happen in face and place areas during 
* Most interesting: Information flowing in visual hierarchies during face and place
* In higher face
