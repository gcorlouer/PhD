## Plan for the 3rd year:

### August-November 2020:
* Write 1st paper on functional connectivity on visually responsive neural population
* Mid september: methods and context written
* End october: results and interpretation
* Remaining work: 
  * improve modeling (wavelet based GC) 
  * functional connectivity (mutual and multi information) 
  * multi granger causlity (between groups of electrodes),
  * statistical inference on Granger causality, maybe something on LPz complexity? 
* I might take some holidays for family stuff

### December 2020 to May 2021:
* Different possible projects: 
  * Functional connectivity on sleep data. Will need to identify interesting electrodes and sleep staging. 
  * Functional connectivity on 'free' recall data could be interesting as well. In particular a question of interest might be to explore information flow 
between hippocampal sharp wave ripples and other regions of interests to explore role of sharp wave ripple in retrival.
* Objective would be to write at least one paper for one of these projects.
* One question I would like to think more about are the question of how brains generate sparse model of the world. How can we model how the brain does dimensionality
reduction of the environment. This might be related to Lionel work on dynamical independance. 

### June-October 2021:
Thesis writing
* June 2021: ASSC conference. Would be good to go to other interesting conference such as comp neuro or OBMH

Regarding structure of the thesis:
* General intro on Granger causality, information theory, causality and their applicability to neuroscience and why they
are interesting to consciousness science in particular. 
* After intro, the 2 or 3 prepublished papers about previous topics I would have hopefully written by then will follow
* General discussion of the previous work and how they fit together and maybe how they bring something to the scientific table
