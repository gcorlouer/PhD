## Accomplish
* Matlab engine up and running
* Can call any function from matlab in python
* Learn Path class in python
* Thought a bit about overall code structure need more
* Found a way to run matlab in atom via octave kernel
* Discovered important ecosystem around MNE in neuroiaging
* Wrote general description of infoflow PP
* Set up some CDPATH and learnt about symbolic links
* Read up on [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/getting_started.html) starter pack
* Read up [OBMH](https://cobidasmeeg.wordpress.com/) recommandation for reproducible MEEG analysis
*
## TODO
* Read [tutorial](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8708690) on FC
* Organise clearly data and code structure following BIDS and OBMH recommandation
* Work on new code structure
* Think about lab note organisation
* Call data with MNE and call preproc function
