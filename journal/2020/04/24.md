# Done
* Import raw data
* Changed channel type to ECoG and miscelenous channels
* Create SUMA mapping with relevant field
* Output a dataframe and csv files of relevant info about intracranial electrodes

# Problems
* Some inconsistenties in the electrodes info. Not the same as digital channel for some channels (miscelanous channels missing)
* Not clear with coordinate systems to use
* Code not quite loopable to other subjects yet

# ToDo
* Compare electrodes with digitized channels
* Select channels per ROIs in a flexible manner
* Keep electrodes relevant for vision for now?
* Drop depth and hyppocampal channels?
* Number of electrodes in V1/V2/MT, visual areas
* Look other brodman areas
* Run preproc
