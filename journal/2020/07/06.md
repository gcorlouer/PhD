### Done
* Planned PhD: set up time line for 1st draft paper and following
* Epoched visual HFB data in equally spaced events for GC analysis
* Pairwise conditional GC up and running with modeling
* Models order reasonable, about 6 for VAR and 17 for SS (although would be good to check litterature), with 17 visual channels
* GC difficult to interpret, wonder how Lionel got is GC between -1 and 1 in psychedelic paper
* Interview with Michael: decided to set up another one where he will present his work on GC and TVB
* Started writing draft paper
### Comments
I'm happy that I have a better idea of timelines! I want to have a better idea of which specific thing the paper is accomplishing which is unclear
I wonder exactly what HFB is tracking: local firing rate, population firing rate? How much population? Why the raw LFP is not that interesting
I also wondered why raw LFP not that interesting?
