### Done
* Lab meeting: interesting oppotunity with Frederico, FMRI and GC on Ising models
* Journal club: difficult to differenciate integration and non integration models
* ECoG: pb of selecting face and place epochs solved, did a new detection of visual electrodes
and seems plausible
* Need to check grand average now

### What have we learnt
Well that really I'm coding in dangerous way, also If I have a doubt about something
it is really worth clearing this doubt and avoiding letting it slipped through which
could just lead to bad work. Ways to code in less dangerous way: version control...
But it just seems quite hard to do VC in efficient way. Also I don'tthink 
I am testing code effectively, I seem to be shooting myself in the foot too often.
