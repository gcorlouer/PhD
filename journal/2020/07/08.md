### Done
* Finally detected all visual channels, for good this time! Victory :) 
* Started GC analysis, there seems to be some difference between face and place
selective elctrodes during prefered vs non prefered at. Strangely it seems we observe
info flow between lower and higher electrode in non prefered category but not in prefered
category. 
* Need more exploration though !

### Further work:
* Need more thorough exploration of GC analysis
* Use aparc label
* Also maybe select a few channel after GC is computed so colormap is easier to interpret
* Change event interval
* Sliding window analysis 
* Functional connectivity of ourse
* Maybe can compute GC density or GC between group of electrodes as well
