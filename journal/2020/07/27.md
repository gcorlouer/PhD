### Introspection
* Decided to carefully plan analysis for the 3rd year before holidays, still a long way to go
* Presented poster at PGR
* Did some overview of litterature, it really seems that papers on ECoG GC are rare or not very good and that I could do a good methodological contribution
* Read Pagnotta paper on benchmarking GC. It is an interesting paper, suggesting that non parametric wavelets and multitapers methods might be able to handle 
non stationary of the like we got from stimulus CIFAR data. Parameter of spectral estimation like center of wavelets, or number of tapers act as bias-variance
parameters and should be adapted to the anlysis. They will probably be the thing to play around once running various analysis
* Wrote overview of paper, methodological contributions and neuro contrib. Still need to draw flowchart.
