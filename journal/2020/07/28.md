### Introspect
* Lab meeting, interesting discussion on cancellation vs sharpening of expectation in bayesian frameworked.
Was a bit confusing, cancellation framework is not very well defined
* Draw a flowchart for analysis in first paper
* Planned PhD more specifically. And expectation from PhD.
* One methodological paper, one neuro paper (visual + maybe free recall), sleep paper. Would be cool to have maths paper as well
* Need to write what I can before I go on holidays, in particular methods section and some context. 
* I learnt to use inkscape to day wooo
