### Modeling
* Don't fall in love with model: importance of model diversity and being adapted to the goal/question
* Formulate question, read up state of the art, specify question, select model to answer q, implement, iterate...
* Look at bootstrap to understand how to ocmpute CI without analyitic distribution
* Interesting that linear models mean linear in parameter but can be non linear in inputs
