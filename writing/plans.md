What I expect from my PhD:

### Methodological Contributions
* Running Granger causality and information theoretic functional connectivity on ECoG, using HFB envelope as proxy for local neural firing rates
* In particular GC and FC will be run at the electrodes level and at the region level (from lower visual areas to fusyform face gyrus lateral occipital)
* More specifically we run pairwise conditional GC at the electrodes level and mvgc at the ROI level (resp. for functional connectivity)
* A potential important contribution is exploring how to deal with non stationarity induced by transient increase in neural firing upon stimuli presentation
* Success in dealing with non stationarities will be evaluated from VAR, state space and non parametric (Wavelets+multitaper) model comparisons. We know from
previous work that non parametric approach should be able to handle the kind of non stationarity we face. Convergence between those models could be a suggestion
that VAR and SS models capture significant causal contribution even though non stationary asumption are violated. 
* An additional validation of methods would be to test them against virtual brain data
* Running these methods on other dataset: sleep and freerecall 
* More speculative: compare with deep learning approach
* More speculative: Algebraic topology and GC
* More speculative: other causality methods from econometrics methods (instrumental variables for example)
### Neuroscience contributions;
* Explore different modes of information flow induced by category specific stimuli in visually responsive neural populations.
* Explore different modes of information flow in different sleep stages
* Explore complexity from LPzc on iEEG in various sleep stages (some preprocessing would need to be updated probably)
* More speculative: Explore the role of information flow between hyppocampal sharp wave ripples and other area in cortex

### Mathematical, conceptual contributions:
More speculative here as I don't have a clear idea of what to contribute too, although I think this could be the area I could contribute one paper within a few 100 of hours of work.
* Cointegration (would need to catch up with Lionel on this)
* Statistical tests for state space models
* Information theoretic interpretation of predictive processing
* Formalising and measuring sparsity/dimensionality reduction in neural data
