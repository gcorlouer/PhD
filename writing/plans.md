### Methodological research
What would be methodological contribution: 
* Doing GC on HFB ECoG: on stimuli data, with validation from simulation.
* Showing methods to run Granger causality analysis on ECoG data and virtual brain validation
* Run functional connectivity on high gamma
* Run directed functional connectivity on high gamma
* Novelty comes from the fact that no studies on ECoG which is interesting

Plan of the analysis:
* Run simple things first: correlation and pairwise granger causality (model based)
* With statistical inference  
* Learn to use the virtual brain (follow tutorial on the topic)
* Run LPzc 
*
